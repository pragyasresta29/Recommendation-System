# Recommendation-System
This is an attempt to create a recommendation system using Karl Pearson's coefficient and Euclidean's distance.

In this project I have used an original dataset from movielens. The website is of sample purpose to show how recommendation can be shown.

##Steps to view the working of recommendation System
* Copy the project folder to your local server.
* open 'index.html' page
* Register from the login page
* Enter your login credentials

Output:
After successful login you'll see list of 5 movies on the right bar.

##Working of the website:
In the dataset I have used there are lot of data about user's rating which is assigned to a user id. Since it is a sample website,there is no user rating for the logged user. So, I assigned one of the id of data to the user to generate recommendation of movies. I have not focussed on the design part since, the main purpose of this project was to create recommendation.

##Future implementations:
* create a working website to create recommendation from user's actual data.
* can filter the ratings to show popular movies to new users as enough data about their preferences is not stored.
