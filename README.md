# Recommendation-System
This is an attempt to create a recommendation system using Karl Pearson's coefficient and Euclidean's distance.

In this project I have used an original dataset from movielens. Here, the recommendation engine was built using user-user and item-item based collaborative filtering. The source code of the recommendation engine can be retrieved from the "recommendation.py" file. The website is of sample purpose to show how recommendation can be shown.

##Steps to view the working of recommendation System
* Copy the project folder to your local server.
* open 'index.html' page
* Register from the login page
* Enter your login credentials

Output:
After successful login you'll see list of 5 movies on the right bar.

##Working of the website:
In the dataset I have used there are lot of data about user's rating which is assigned to a user id. Since it is a sample website,there is no user rating for the logged user. So, I assigned one of the id of data to the user to generate recommendation of movies. I have not focussed on the design part since, the main purpose of this project was to create recommendation.

##Future implementations:
* create a working website to create recommendation from user's actual data.
* can filter the ratings to show popular movies to new users as enough data about their preferences is not stored.
